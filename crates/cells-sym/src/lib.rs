//! Symbolic engines for the cells core, behind one interface.
//!
//! A math cell is an `f64` cell holding a [`Handle`]; the core never looks
//! inside an expression, it only calls the operations of [`SymEngine`]. Two
//! engines implement it: [`flat::Flat`] (engine A, a flat hash-consed arena
//! written for this prototype) and, in `cells-sym-mer`, math-expressions-rs
//! (engine R), which is also the behavior oracle. See `docs/history/plan-5.md`.
