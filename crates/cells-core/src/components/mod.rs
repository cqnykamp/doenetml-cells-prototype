//! Stripped-down component definitions: which props each tag has, where each
//! prop's value comes from, and its default. This is the only place that
//! knows DoenetML tag vocabulary.
//!
//! A component's props are its slots; a prop may be computed from the
//! component's other props by an operator (`PropFrom::Computed`), which is how
//! a component such as `<slider>` describes its whole value chain without any
//! code of its own: the chain is data, and inversion through it is the
//! generic operator inverse.
//!
//! This file holds the types, the lookups the build uses, and the list of
//! every type (`component_types!`). Each type's definition (its docs, its
//! prop table, its row and its named prop positions) is in a family file:
//! `containers.rs`, `geometry.rs`, `inputs.rs`, `structure.rs`,
//! `values.rs`. `define.rs` has the builders they are written with, and
//! `prop.rs` gathers the named positions.
