//! Credit and section numbers: cells wired from the expanded tree.
//!
//! Both follow the current core, where a reactive choice's inactive cases
//! are not components at all: an answer in an inactive case is not scored
//! and a section in one takes no number. Here every case is built, so each
//! inactive case contributes through a *gate*, the product of the `active`
//! cells of the cases around it. A flip changes gates, then credits and
//! numbers, on an ordinary tick. `hide` gates nothing, as in the current
//! core.
//!
//! **Credit.** The document and each section that aggregates scores hold
//! the weighted mean of their scored items' credit: the answers and
//! aggregating sections inside them, looking through sections that do not
//! aggregate (whose own credit is 0). An item's weight is multiplied by its
//! gate. With no weight (nothing scored, or nothing active) the credit is 1.
//!
//! **Numbers.** A section's `number` is 1 plus the gates of the sections
//! before it among its siblings, where siblings are counted through the
//! containers the current core expands in place (choices, cases, groups,
//! repeats, collects). A full number such as 2.1 is read from the `number`
//! cells of the section and its section ancestors (`Document::section_number`).
